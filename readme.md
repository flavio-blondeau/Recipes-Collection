# Recipes Collection App

This project aims to create a script or an app that stores recipes and allow to search for
a recipe you need by name or ingredient.

A first draft of the app is shown in the file *cli.py*, which contains
the script for command line interaction.

The file *gui.py* is the script for a graphical user interface
version of the app.

The *recipes.json* file contains all recipes stored using the app.
